### Abstract

TDGE - a lighweight 2D GameEngine, specialized for Tower Defense Games:

Tower defense games are a subgenre of strategy games in
which players place defensive structures to prevent waves of
enemies from reaching a target. Despite the popularity of this
genre, most general-purpose game engines, such as Unity
or Godot, require substantial customization to implement
core tower defense mechanics like wave management, enemy
pathfinding, and modular tower behaviors. This complexity
often leads to duplicated effort and unnecessary overhead for
developers focusing solely on this genre.
To address this, the Tower Defense Game Engine (TDGE)
was developed as a specialized 2D game engine tailored to
the unique requirements of tower defense games. The primary
goals of TDGE include providing a modular architecture, simplifying the implementation of common mechanics, optimizing
performance for 2D environments, and
